TASK:
- Add new features to the systemm so that we can begin selling a new category of item

CURRENT SYSTEM:
- sell_in : Sellinn value -> number of days we have to sell the item
- quality : Quality value -> how valuable the item is
=> selling_val-- and quality-- : at the end of each day 

SPECS:
+ if sell_in < 0 -> quality-- * 2
+ quality is never negative
+ "Aged Brie" -> quality++ when day passes
+ “Sulfuras” -> quality previous days = quality now
+ quality < 50
+ “Backstage passes” -> quality++ when selling_val--
	quality +2 -> days_left = 10 to 5
	quality +3 -> days_left = 5 to 0
	quality = 0 -> due_day
+ “Conjured” quality-- *2
